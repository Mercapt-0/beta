I started from starting I saw you and I never wanted to be friend or whatsoever with you, cause there were a lot of shit along with you I never wanted to be part of rather it was kunal, Jaiswal or Kunj, but destiny has different plans we all grouped together and I tbh thought that you could get me insight on GRESHA there was point we started sharing things you tell me yours I told you mine and never wanna anything you ended up being friends, sharing similarities to endless timed calls it make our bond stronger which made us best friends. I never had Girl as a friend also before you and i never intended to make any but dk it was distinct with you. Ofc I thanked you I met you friends and the stuff a lot stuff happened and I really forget all those moments. Yk I never meant to hurt anyone but in case I do I really hurt you and all I can say is Sorry, and still no ones know me like you and it's fact.And I never do anything for a reason and I do have one tbh, well this was what an abrupt end, i never wanted but in your case it happened, I don't how it works for you but you always gonna be my best friend cause i stick to that what so ever happen, Though Pleasure that you are part of my life I never forget. tbh I am not guilty for what I have done but i am sorry for the heart or you may cry. I do shit thing but it never affect anyone tbh and I never wanted anything worse for you too. I don't how you process that but that is what it is. Last two words Sorry .... Thank You .....",
